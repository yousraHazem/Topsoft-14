  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # root 'welcome#index'

  # Example of regular route:
  # get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  # get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  # resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  # resources :products do
  # member do
  # get 'short'
  # post 'toggle'
  # end
  #
  # collection do
  # get 'sold'
  # end
  # end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  # resources :products do
  # resources :comments, :sales
  # resource :seller
  # end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  # resources :products do
  # resources :comments
  # resources :sales do
  # get 'recent', on: :collection
  # end
  # end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  # concern :toggleable do
  # post 'toggle'
  # end
  # resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  # resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  # namespace :admin do
  # # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  # # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  # resources :products
  # end
